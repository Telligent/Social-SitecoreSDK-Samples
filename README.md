# Sitecore SDK for Zimbra Social Samples
##Sitecore Social SDK Samples
####Dependencies
The Sitecore SDK requires that you have installed and are running Zimbra Social and Sitecore.  As Such this SDK has dependencies on libraries that for licensing reasons are not made available as part of this SDK.  You will need to obtain these libraries from their respective installations and copy them to the */lib* folder before compiling.  They are listed below.

**Sitecore**
- Sitecore.Client.dll
- Sitecore.Kernel.dll
- Sitecore.Mvc.dll

**Zimbra Social**
You will need to also include all the files from the SDK and a compiled version of the SDK itself.

All the dlls should be placed in a folder called /lib at the root and references adjusted as needed.



This is a work in progress
