You will need to obtain these libraries from their respective installations and copy them to the */lib* folder before compiling.  They are listed below.

**Sitecore**
- Sitecore.Client.dll
- Sitecore.Kernel.dll
- Sitecore.Mvc.dll

**Zimbra Social**
You will need to also include all the files from the SDK and a compiled version of the SDK itself.

All the dlls should be placed in a folder called /lib at the root and references adjusted as needed.
